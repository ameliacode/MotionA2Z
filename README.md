## All about locomotions from A to Z

Feel free to update anytime :) Currently rough draft-ing..  
Computer Graphics has come a long way for the past decades. Not only it has been limited to an idea, but it has been developed to make its access easier to public, such. as non-linear interactive media. With the development in performance of computer, users nowadays can experience diverse virtual environment, immersing themselves to virtual character. Therefore it has become essential to fit the users’ expectation of undistracting interaction for characters to move similar to reality in virtual space.  

### Introduction
As there aren’t many information about locomotion field or community to share with, I had hard time finding what to start during my first year of masters course. I have decided to open this repository to give help to anyone out there, who have slight interest or wants to start studying locomotion field.
